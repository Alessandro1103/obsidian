# Intelligent Agents

An **Agent** is something that perceive the environment through sensor and act through actuators (humans, animals...). The agent does what it does trying to maximize a performance measure. This is not always possible, due to mechanism or algorithm loss. 
There are 2 kind of agents:
- Omniscient agent: knows everything about the environment and the actual effects of its action.
- Rational agent: makes the best of what he has at its disposal.
