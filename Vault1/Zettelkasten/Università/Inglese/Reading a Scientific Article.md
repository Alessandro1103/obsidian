# Reading a Scientific Article

We should not approach a scientific article like a textbook, we ha to stop, think about what we just read, elaborate, critic.
1. **Skim the article**: try to get a basic overview.
2. **Grasp the vocabulary**: there are specific terms, dependent from what article are u reading.
3. **Identify the structure**: most journals use an IMRD structure:
	- Abstract: a quick overview, with purpose, methodology etc
	- Introduction: background of information about the topic. why its important
	- Methods: technical details of how the experiments were carried out, an how to do it
	- Results: graph, pictures, data
	- Discussion: opinions, interpretations
4. **Read the bibliography**: can lead you to other useful resources.
5. **Reflect**: make your own conclusion
6. **Read the article a second time in chronological order**: reinforce your overall understanding

Abstract -> Highlights -> Conclusion -> Graphs -> Introduction -> Methods -> Results -> Discussion -> Conclusion ->
