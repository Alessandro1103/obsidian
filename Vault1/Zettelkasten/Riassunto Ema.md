## Consumer Brand
The document titled "Consumer Brand Engagement, Satisfaction and Brand Loyalty: A Comparative Study Between Functional and Emotional Brand Relationships" by Teresa Fernandes and Mariana Moreira is a comprehensive research paper focusing on consumer brand engagement (CBE) and its impact on brand loyalty (BL), particularly examining the differences in CBE in functional versus emotional consumer–brand relationships. Here are the key points summarized from the entire document:

1. **Study Objective**: The purpose of the study is to understand differences in CBE according to the functional or emotional nature of consumer–brand relationships and its direct and/or indirect impact on BL. It also aims to compare CBE and Satisfaction as predictors of BL, considering the two types of consumer–brand relationships.

2. **Key Findings**: The study validates CBE as a three-dimensional construct, stronger for emotional than functional brand relationships, and shows its significant direct and indirect impact on BL. It proves that the effects of CBE on BL, directly or indirectly through Satisfaction, are stronger for emotional relationships, while Satisfaction is a stronger direct predictor of BL for functional brand relationships.

3. **Methodology**: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on two independent samples, focusing on brands with which respondents had functional and emotional relationships, respectively. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used for data analysis.

4. **Consumer Brand Engagement**: CBE is defined as a consumer’s cognitive, emotional, and behavioral brand-related activities related to specific interactions. The study underscores the importance of CBE in fostering deeper, relationship-based consumer engagement.

5. **Functional vs. Emotional Brand Relationships**: The research distinguishes between functional brand relationships (focused on utilitarian aspects) and emotional brand relationships (centered on symbolic benefits and self-expressive value).

6. **Results on Brand Loyalty**: CBE has a positive direct impact on BL. Satisfaction mediates the CBE to BL path. The study found that CBE is a stronger direct predictor of BL for emotional than for functional consumer–brand relationships.

7. **Managerial Implications**: The findings suggest that brand managers should engage consumers beyond transactional satisfaction, especially for brands aiming to establish an emotional connection. The role of CBE in influencing consumer satisfaction and loyalty offers crucial insights for brand management strategies.

8. **Conclusions**: The study concludes that CBE is crucial for both functional and emotional brands in enhancing brand loyalty. It adds to the existing knowledge by establishing the mediating role of satisfaction and comparing the contribution of CBE and satisfaction to BL according to the nature of consumer–brand relationships.

## Consumer Identity

The document titled "Imaginary Futures: Liminoid Advertising and Consumer Identity" by Chris Hackley, Rungpaka Amy Hackley, and Dina H. Bassiouni, published in the Journal of Marketing Communications, explores the concept of liminoid advertising and its impact on consumer identity. This comprehensive research paper delves into how advertising often implies that brands can act as doorways to new identities and lifestyles. Here's a detailed summary of the document:

1. **Concept of Liminoid Advertising**: The paper introduces the concept of liminoid advertising, drawing on anthropological theory. Liminoid experiences allow for the temporary suspension of personal and social identity, opening up transformational possibilities. Unlike liminal experiences, which are often tied to ritual processes, liminoid experiences are voluntary, repeatable, and engaged in for enjoyment.

2. **Advertising Appeals**: The study discusses various advertising appeals, distinguishing them as either emotional or rational. It notes how liminoid advertising suggests that consuming a promoted product or brand can act as a gateway to a world of flux and experimentation, where consumer identities are fluid and impermanent.

3. **Consumer Identity and Liminality**: The paper reviews literature on liminality in consumer identity, showing how consumption plays a symbolic role in identity exploration and change. It discusses how Turner’s theories of liminality and liminoid experiences are adapted to understand consumer behavior, specifically in the context of marketing and advertising.

4. **Case Examples**: The authors provide examples of advertising campaigns that exemplify liminoid appeals, demonstrating the novelty and salience of this concept in marketing. These examples illustrate how brands use liminoid advertising to suggest the potential for personal transformation through consumption.

5. **Socio-Cultural Implications**: The paper cautions that while liminoid appeals resonate with consumers for their ostensibly liberatory and self-actualizing potential, they could contribute to rising social disharmony and psychological distress. It highlights the need for understanding the broader social impact of such advertising strategies.

6. **Practical Implications for Marketers**: For brand managers, the study underscores the importance of understanding the role of liminoid advertising in engaging consumers. It suggests that liminoid advertising can be a powerful tool for motivating consumers by tapping into their desire for identity experimentation and transformation.

7. **Conclusions and Future Research**: The paper concludes by emphasizing the significance of liminoid advertising in contemporary consumer culture. It calls for further research to categorize liminoid advertising appeals and investigate their impact on different consumer demographics and sectors.

This comprehensive analysis of the document covers the entire content, providing insights into how the concept of liminoid advertising is relevant in understanding consumer behaviour and the role of advertising in shaping consumer identity.

## Disclosure

The document titled "Consumer Disclosure" by Tami Kim, Kate Barasz, and Leslie K. John provides a comprehensive exploration of consumer disclosure, particularly in the context of the digital age. This document, spanning 11 pages in total, offers a deep dive into various aspects of how consumers share and disclose information. Here is a summary covering the entire document:

1. **Evolution of Consumer Disclosure**: The paper starts by highlighting how technological advancements have led to a shift in the ways consumers share information, expanding beyond traditional interpersonal communication to include various new forms of disclosure.

2. **Framework for Disclosure**: The authors introduce a conceptual framework to understand consumer disclosure. This framework considers two dimensions: the nature of the disclosure (active vs. passive) and the parties involved (consumer-to-consumer or consumer-to-firm).

3. **Active Disclosure**:
   - **Drivers of Active Disclosure**: Explored in detail are the factors influencing active disclosure, including the characteristics of the discloser, situational influences, the nature of the information being disclosed, and the influence of others.
   - **Psychological Drivers**: The paper discusses the psychological drivers behind disclosure, including the desire to be authentically known versus presenting an idealized image.

4. **Impact of Communication Modes**: The effect of different communication modes (online vs. face-to-face, written vs. spoken) on the nature of disclosure is analyzed.

5. **Content Characteristics in Disclosure**: The emotionality, valence, and framing of the content are identified as key factors influencing the likelihood of its disclosure.

6. **Influence of Others**: The paper highlights how others' behavior, including the actions of non-human entities like chatbots, affects an individual's propensity to disclose.

7. **Passive Disclosure**:
   - This section reviews the limited but growing research on passive disclosure, focusing on inferences made by observers based on passively shared information and the expectations of disclosers regarding the use and collection of such information.

8. **Potential for Future Research**: Various avenues for future research are outlined, especially concerning the differences in consumer disclosure across commercial and social contexts.

9. **Managerial Implications and Conclusions**: The document concludes by emphasizing the importance for firms to understand the changing nature of consumer disclosure, especially in relation to data collection and privacy concerns.

This summary encapsulates the key points and findings across the entire document, providing a comprehensive overview of the research conducted in the area of consumer disclosure. [Consumer Disclosure](https://myaidrive.com/476AExCEEBUZKpdb/03---Disclos.pdf?pdfPage=1-11)

## Experience

The document titled "From experiential psychology to consumer experience" by Bernd Schmitt, J. Joško Brakus, and Lia Zarantonello critiques the conventional view of happiness derived from experiential versus material purchases. The authors propose a nuanced perspective on consumer experience, contrasting it with the psychological model by Gilovich and colleagues. Here's a summary of the entire document:

1. **Critique of Experiential vs. Material Purchases**: The authors critique the research program that suggests people derive more happiness from experiential purchases than from material ones. They argue that experiences cannot be purchased like goods, and the comparison between material possessions and experiences is not on equal footing.

2. **Material Goods and Experiences**: They assert that while material goods can be bought and sold, experiences are part of a self-generated, internal process and not directly purchased.

3. **Extraordinary Experiences vs. Ordinary Possessions**: The paper discusses the bias in comparing extraordinary experiences with ordinary material purchases. It argues that significant material possessions can also lead to extraordinary experiences.

4. **Confounding Dimensions**: The authors point out potential confounding factors in the empirical studies that compare material and experiential purchases, such as tangibility (goods vs. services) and self-construal (interdependent vs. independent).

5. **Continuum of Material and Experiential Purchases**: They challenge the idea that material and experiential purchases are opposite ends of a single continuum, noting that experiences and possessions do not form one continuum.

6. **Consumer Experience Model**: The paper presents a consumer experience model that views materialism and experientialism as two separate dimensions, both contributing to consumer happiness in terms of pleasure and meaning. 

7. **Materialism and Experientialism**: The authors propose that any purchase can be viewed along two dimensions: materialism (value from material aspects) and experientialism (value from experiential aspects).

8. **Brand Experience as a Mediator**: The construct of "brand experience" is highlighted as a key mediator between consumption and happiness. Brands can foster well-being by evoking specific types of experiences.

9. **Happiness from Pleasure and Meaning**: They distinguish between two paths to happiness: a hedonic path (happiness as pleasure) and a eudaimonic path (happiness from fulfilling meaningful goals). The materialism dimension may be more predictive of pleasure-based happiness, while experientialism may be more predictive of meaning-based happiness.

10. **Conclusion**: The paper concludes by suggesting that a good life in a consumerist society involves integrating material and experiential consumptions, contrary to the idea of favoring experiential over material purchases.

This summary encapsulates the key arguments and findings of the document, providing a comprehensive overview of the authors' critique of the prevailing views on experiential vs. material purchases and their proposed model of consumer experience.
