# CSP PT2

**Inference**: deducing additional constraints, that follow from the already known constraints

Definition of **Equivalence**: 
Let $\gamma = (V, D, C)$ and $\gamma' = (V, D', C')$ be constraint networks sharing the same set of variables. We say that $\gamma$ and $\gamma$ are equivalent, written \gamma  γ, if every solution of γ is a solution of γ 0 , and every solution of γ 0 is a solution of γ
