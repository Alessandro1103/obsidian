# ML ExamQuestion

- The optimal bias classifier is returning a weighted average of all prediction of all the hypothesis. This is impractical because we can not iterate over all the possible hypothesis
- Is the $h_{MAP}$ the best we can do? No: 
  ![[Pasted image 20231217181737.png|300]] we have 0.6 of minus, better than 0.4 of plus
- What happens when we have noise data in KNN and K=1? With �=1k=1, the model is extremely sensitive to outliers and noise. If a data point has a noisy label, the model will strongly rely on that single point, leading to overfitting
