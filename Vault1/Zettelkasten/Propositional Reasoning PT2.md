## Davis-Putnam

The DPLL procedure is a complete SAT solver. A SAT problem is a boolean satisfiability problem (NP-complete).

**Example**:

We can say that $\Delta$ is unsatisfiable if the unit propagation is sound (return the same result -> does not improve)

The DPLL is similar to the BacktrackingWithInference, with Inference() = unit propagation

The Unit Propagation (UP) Rule corresponds to a calculus:
Definition of **Unit Resolution**:
Unit Resolution is the calculus consisting of the following inference rule:
$$
\frac{C \dot{\cup}}{}
$$
