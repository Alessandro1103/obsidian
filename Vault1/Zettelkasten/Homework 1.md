Considering the figure below illustrating a planarÂ $\underline{R}RRR$ parallelogram structure with a camera mounted at the end of the link of length $l+d$:
- determine the degrees of mobility of the camera
- define the task describing the camera motion using a minimum number of parameters
- determine the differential kinematics for the task defined in the previous point
- determine the singularities of the mechanism.
