# Abstract to Computer Vision


The purpose of my project is related to research on ground-to-air image matching. In particular, avoiding the use of state-of-the-art methods, I want to follow the method presented by the University of Central Florida in 2019. The project presents a network that synthesises an aerial image from a terrestrial one using a cross-synthesis network generator, so this must be compared with the reference image. Research is also planned on the aggregation of multiscale features to preserve image representations at different scales. The target dataset to be used is the CVUSA, one of the main choices for matching terrestrial aerial views.
