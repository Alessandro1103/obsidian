# Homework1 (cose da aggiungere)

## Post-Pruning (ci vuole molto)

To improve the algorithm and prevent overfitting, one approach I can try, specifically for the decision tree model is to cut the subtree rooted at a specific node. I provided an algorithm that implements post-pruning of a decision tree using cost-complexity pruning. Then I evaluated the accuracy of each pruned tree on the test set and then identifying the alpha value associated with the highest accuracy.

``` python
```

In fact, I got an improvement, even if very small. I went from 0.975976 to 0.976937 accuracy. To get this result I had to wait 31m 52.4s, which was unexpected and defenetly too much for the result obtained.
