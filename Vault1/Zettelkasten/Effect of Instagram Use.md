# Effect of Instagram Use

The high adoption of social media is especially important to Singapore, given that the government's "smart nation", aims to utilize information communication technologies to improve living and build a closer community among Singaporeans. Scholars indicated that social anxiety could arise from managing a large network of social media friends, feeling jealous of their lives, and the "fear of missing out" on activities in online interactions. 
It's in out interest create a `three-stagemodel` of health promotion using interactive media, let's see the 3 stages:
1. is implementation and use of interactive media
2. depends on the interplay of user, media and message characteristics
3. health outcomes

Social anxiety results from the personal evaluation of real or imagined social situations. Social comparison consists of people's biological inclination to evaluate their situation, skill, and overall identity in comparison to others, based on the information they receive about others, might lea to increased social anxiety. Some people rank lower than others, which could increase mental access to negativa self-assessment and self-imagery. Even downward social comparison could enhance one's social anxiety. People just concern about how one is being evaluated by others. On social media, people often selectively reveal themselves and construct their preferred identities or characteristics. Social media generates feedback, such followers, like, comments, and retweets.
Self-esteem is a person's positive or negative self-evaluation. Low self-esteem can increase social anxiety, bringing less interaction. People tend to depend on social approval for a better sense of self. Usually these people are prone to be self- victimizing and blaming others for their social failures.
These studies have several limitations:
- Cross-lagged panel, we have a pattern to follow, we can doing different things at the same time.
- The participants were recruited from convenience samples. 
- This study only measured the frequency of Instagram use, using one single item.
- One mediation pathway

Theoretical Implications:
- More comprehensive theoretical framework by the three-stage model
- The three-stage model can be well applied to a different context.
- Contributes to the social media literature by identifying pathway that includes proximal and intermediate outcomes. 
Practical Implications:
- try to avoid frequently comparing abilities and opinions with others
- for health educators and promoters, enhancing emotional well-being is of significance.
- Campaigns that increase people's self-esteem in the digital era
- school educators that guide to the appropriate use of Instagram to enhance students' emotional health.
