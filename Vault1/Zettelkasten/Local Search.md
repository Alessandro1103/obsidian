# Local Search

"Local search" refers to an optimization approach that focuses on finding acceptable solutions in the vicinity of the current solution in a search space. Instead of exploring the entire solution space, local search confines itself to exploring the "neighborhood" of the current solution.

Example:

Local search algorithm are not systematic, this can lead to a lack of guarantees regarding the global optimality of the solution found, it doesn't look for all the solution but a better one. This means that the algorithms use very little memory (constant space). It finds reasonable solutions even in large or infinite state spaces.
