# Homework1

The first step taken to work on this homework works on finding a solution. To see if everything was well managed I try to train and test the dataset over a random method. I didn't think about a pre-processing method, I could use a dataset standardization, or check the outliners to see if I could improve the distribution to get a better solution. Avoiding every kind of semplification, or improvements, I just run the code over the DecisionalTree() method, obtaining a proper solution, with sufficient evaluation. Just to verify the correct esamination of
