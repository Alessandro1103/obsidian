## SIFT

We'll delve into the **SIFT** (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm, which is widely used in computer vision for object recognition, robotica mapping, and image stitching. SIFT is used both as a detector and a descriptor. It detects and describes local features in images. 

1. **Multi-scale Extreme Detection**: This step involves searching for stable features across multiple scales. It uses a scale-space representation.
2. **Keypoint Localization**: After identifying potential interest points, SIFT refines these keypoints to achieve more accurate localization.
3. **Orientation Assignment**: Each keypoint is assigned one or more orientations based on local image gradient directions. This step ensures that the keypoint descriptor is rotation invariant.
4. **Keypoint Descriptor**: The local image gradients are measured at the selected scale in the region around each keypoint. These are transformed into a representation that allows for significant levels of local shape distortion and change in illumination.
### SIFT detector

The SIFT detector uses the **Difference of Gaussians** (DoG) method to approximate the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG). 
$$
\text{DoG}(x, y, \sigma) = G(x, y, k\sigma) - G(x, y, \sigma)

$$
where $G(x,y,\sigma)$ is the Gaussian blur at scale $\sigma$ and $k$ is a constant that determines the scale multiplication for each subsequent Gaussian blur.

In order to find the best keypoint we look at the neighbors, 8 in the same level, and 9 in the plane upper and down (each), so we ends in 26 neighbors.

The image pyramid is created by repeatedly blurring and subsampling the image. Each level of the pyramid represents a different octave (scale) in the scale-space representation. At each octave the image is progressively blurred more to create a set of images each at a higher scale. To go to the next octave, the image is downsampled by a factor of 2.

**Illumination-thresholding**
During the process of keypoint detection using the Difference of Gaussians images, one important step is to remove low contrast features (below a threshold), don't provide reliable information.

#### Keypoint Orientation

The next thing is to assign an orientation to each keypoint, this orientation provides rotation invariance. For all levels, compute Gradient magnitude and orientation.

Then we create an histogram, this histogram spans 360 degrees, divided into 36 bins (each representing a 10-degree interval). The contributions of the gradients to the histogram are weighted by their magnitudes, ensuring that directions in which the gradient is stronger have a greater influence on the histogram.

>In this case, taking the gradient from a picture we don't see, the gradient direction of a pixel is about 18 degrees. We go into the histogram and add a value proportional to the magnitude of that orientation. This is done for all pixels we think are keypoints and the ones near them. At the end the peak of the histogram is the keypoint. All the peaks over the 80% are converted in new keypoints.

### SIFT descriptor

For each detected keypoint is assigned:
- Location
- Scale (magnitude)
- Orientation

>[!Algorithm build SIFT descriptor]
>The steps of building the SIFT descriptor are as following:
>1. Use the Gaussian blurred image that corresponds to the keypoint's scale
>2. Select the 16x16 window around the keypoint
>3. Calculate the gradient angle of the 16x16 window, and then rotate it of the keypoint's angle, so that the window becomes more robust to rotations
>4. Divide the 16x16 window in 4x4 grids (16 cells) 
>5. Compute the histogram (8 bins for 360 degrees) for each 2x2 grid

The result is a SIFT descriptor of 128 vectors: 4x4 histograms, each with 8 orientation bins.

SIFT descriptor properties:
- Invariant to rotation (if we assume that a rotation of x, will generate a keypoint that is rotated by x)
- Invariant to scale (DoG scaled the image at the start)![[Screenshot from 2024-06-07 10-45-54.png|200]]
- Invariant to illumination
- Slightly robustness to affine transformation and to noise![[Screenshot from 2024-06-07 10-46-24.png|200]]
## SURF

The SURF is a feature detection framework, his procedure is divided in:
1. Interest Point Detection
2. Interest Point Description
3. Interest Point Matching
### SURF detection

**Integral Images**: are tool used to quickly and efficiently  calculate the sum of values in a rectangular subset of a grid. 

![[Screenshot from 2024-06-07 11-07-25.png|200]]

$$
I_{\Sigma}(x, y) = \sum_{i=0}^{x} \sum_{j=0}^{y} I(i, j)
$$

```slide-note

scale: 0.8
```

$$
\text{det}(H_{\text{approx}}) = D_{xx}D_{yy} - (wD_{xy})^2
$$
where $D$ are the box filters (like the one studied for derivatives: $\begin{bmatrix}-1 & -2 & 1\end{bmatrix}$)

![[Screenshot from 2024-06-07 11-17-23.png|300]]

The detector targets areas of the image where the determinant of the Hessian matrix reaches a local maximum.

$$
H(x,\sigma) = \begin{bmatrix}
L_{xx}(x,\sigma) & L_{xy}(x,\sigma)\\
L_{xy}(x,\sigma) & L_{yy}(x,\sigma)
\end{bmatrix}
$$
where $L_{xx}(x,\sigma)$ is the convolution of the Gaussian second order derivative $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}g(\sigma)$.

#### Scale-Space representation

To match interest points across different scales, a pyramidal scale space is built. Rather than serial downsampling, each successive level of the pyramid is built by upscaling the image in parallel. Each scale is defined as the response of the image convolved with a box filter of a certain dimension. The scale space is further divided into octaves.
