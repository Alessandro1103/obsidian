# Digital Humanities

Digital humanities are ate the leading edge of the application of computational technologies to the humanities. It originally focused on developing digital tool, archives and databases. Technology is not invading the academy. Computer networks allows to share digital files about art, poems etc, all over the world. Digital humanities incorporate key insights from languages and literature, history, music, media and communications, computer science and combine these different approaches into new frameworks. 
In their job, digital humanists, have developed new methods, such as computer-based analysis, search and retrieval, topic modelling etc. These methods enable to create more important project with bigger teams. 
The new collections of historical are often publicly available on the web or in digital databases, more available than previously possible with print. Crucial has been the creation of software for analysing, understanding and transforming these digital materials. Digital tools are also freely accessed over the internet.
These digital technologies are connecting humanities to a wider public culture.
