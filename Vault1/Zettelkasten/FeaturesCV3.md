We'll delve into the **SIFT** (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm, which is widely used in computer vision for object recognition, robotica mapping, and image stitching. SIFT is used both as a detector and a descriptor. It detects and describes local features in images. 

1. **Multi-scale Extreme Detection**: This step involves searching for stable features across multiple scales. It uses a scale-space representation.
2. **Keypoint Localization**: After identifying potential interest points, SIFT refines these keypoints to achieve more accurate localization.
3. **Orientation Assignment**: Each keypoint is assigned one or more orientations based on local image gradient directions. This step ensures that the keypoint descriptor is rotation invariant.
4. **Keypoint Descriptor**: The local image gradients are measured at the selected scale in the region around each keypoint. These are transformed into a representation that allows for significant levels of local shape distortion and change in illumination.
## SIFT detector

The SIFT detector uses the **Difference of Gaussians** (DoG) method to approximate the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG). 
$$
\text{DoG}(x, y, \sigma) = G(x, y, k\sigma) - G(x, y, \sigma)

$$
where $G(x,y,\sigma)$ is the Gaussian blur at scale $\sigma$ and $k$ is a constant that determines the scale multiplication for each subsequent Gaussian blur.
