## Introduction
The problem presented is a classification problem, over 2 dataset to train the model, and 2 test, to evaluate the result obtained by the training. The first dataset contains 50000 elements with 100 parameters. 

## First Test
The first step taken to work on this homework works on finding a solution. To see if everything was well managed I try to train and test the dataset over a random method. The test is made over the dataset1. In particular I split the data to create 2 set, one for the training and one for the test. Doing so, I could evaluate the results, in order to generate an appropriate model for the blind test. 
In the first try I didn't think about a pre-processing method, I could use a dataset standardization, or check the outlines to see if I could improve the distribution to get a better solution. Avoiding every kind of simplification, or improvements, I just run the code over the DecisionalTree() method, obtaining a proper solution. Just to verify the correct evaluation over the test, I measured the accuracy: 0.976036, which is very close to the average result I was obtaining, I take this as point of start to improve the code. It's quite good considering the condition already explained before. 

Let's consider the dataset:

In the first image there is the data set 1 with all the classes represented by each colour and a lot of data mixed together making it difficult to distinguish them. For this reason I split the data and extracted a percentage of elements from each group to make the dataset more readable. The test sample represents 33% of the total set of input and the result can be approximated respect to the complete blid test, that
