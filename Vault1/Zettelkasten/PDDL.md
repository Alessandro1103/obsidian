## Schematic Encodings

Schematics encodings use variables that range over objects:
- Predicates instead of STRIPS propositions. Arity: number of vars
- Action schemas instead of STRIPS actions. Arity: number of vars

Schematic action (respectively (pre, add, del)) example:

corresponds to the actions:

## PDDL Grammar

Example:
``` PDDL
(and (or (on A B) (on A C)) 
	 (or (on B A) (on B C)) 
	 (or (on C A) (on A B)))
```
