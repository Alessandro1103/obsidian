The discover of this computer was astonishing, it's such a clever, extraordinary, sophisticated machine. Was found by divers in a ship close to Antikythera (Greece), actually what was found was a hunk of corroded metal. In this ship there were different statues, vases, jewellery and ancient coins. Much later was discovered there were gear wheels inside of the hunk. These gears were incredibly precise with small teeth. It use these wheels to calculate the cycles of the cosmos, like Sun, moon, etc. Now is kept in a Greek museum.
To discover the actual components of the computer, was used an enormous X-ray machine, and took X-ray data of all the 82 surviving fragments of the mechanism. By these test was found a user guide hidden within the folds of corroded bronze. 
This mechanism was so particular and advance that we had to rethink about history of technology completely. 

Feature:
To determine the cycle for all the planets we need 9 outputs, cosmos that we are interested in.
