We'll delve into the **SIFT** (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm, which is widely used in computer vision for object recognition, robotica mapping, and image stitching. SIFT is used both as a detector and a descriptor. It detects and describes local features in images. 

1. **Multi-scale Extreme Detection**: This step involves searching for stable features across multiple scales. It uses a scale-space representation.
2. **Keypoint Localization**: After identifying potential interest points, SIFT refines these keypoints to achieve more accurate localization.
3. **Orientation Assignment**: Each keypoint is assigned one or more orientations based on local image gradient directions. This step ensures that the keypoint descriptor is rotation invariant.
4. **Keypoint Descriptor**: The local image gradients are measured at the selected scale in the region around each keypoint. These are transformed into a representation that allows for significant levels of local shape distortion and change in illumination.
## SIFT detector

The SIFT detector uses the **Difference of Gaussians** (DoG) method to approximate the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG). 
$$
\text{DoG}(x, y, \sigma) = G(x, y, k\sigma) - G(x, y, \sigma)

$$
where $G(x,y,\sigma)$ is the Gaussian blur at scale $\sigma$ and $k$ is a constant that determines the scale multiplication for each subsequent Gaussian blur.

In order to find the best keypoint we look at the neighbors, 8 in the same level, and 9 in the plane upper and down (each), so we ends in 26 neighbors.

The image pyramid is created by repeatedly blurring and subsampling the image. Each level of the pyramid represents a different octave (scale) in the scale-space representation. At each octave the image is progressively blurred more to create a set of images each at a higher scale. To go to the next octave, the image is downsampled by a factor of 2.

**Illumination-thresholding**
During the process of keypoint detection using the Difference of Gaussians images, one important step is to remove low contrast features (below a threshold), don't provide reliable information.

### Keypoint Orientation

The next thing is to assign an orientation to each keypoint, this orientation provides rotation invariance. For all levels, compute Gradient magnitude and orientation.

Then we create an histogram, this histogram spans 360 degrees, divided into 36 bins (each representing a 10-degree interval). The contributions of the gradients to the histogram are weighted by their magnitudes, ensuring that directions in which the gradient is stronger have a greater influence on the histogram.
