## Vision Sensors
For these sensors are used photosensitive element, termed pixel. The most used devices are *CCD* and *CMOS* sensors.

The **CCD** (Charge Coupled Device) sensor consists of a rectangular array of photosites. Due to the photoelectric effect, when a photon hits the semiconductor surface, a number of free electrons are created. This charge is then passed by a transport mechanism to the output amplifier, while at
