## Wumpus

**Wumpus:** The Wumpus is a hazardous creature that can kill the player if they enter its location. It is typically placed randomly in the cave, and the player's goal is to avoid encountering it.
    
**Stench:** Stench is a characteristic smell associated with the presence of the Wumpus. In the game, if the player is in a location adjacent to the Wumpus, they can perceive a stench. Detecting a stench can be crucial for the player to infer the presence and location of the Wumpus and make informed decisions about movement.
