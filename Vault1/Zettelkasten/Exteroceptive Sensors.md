## Vision Sensors
For these sensors are used photosensitive element, termed pixel. The most used devices are *CCD* and *CMOS* sensors.

The **CCD** (Charge Coupled Device) sensor consists of a rectangular array of photosites. Due to the photoelectric effect, when a photon hits the semiconductor surface, a number of free electrons are created. This charge is then passed by a transport mechanism to the output amplifier. The electric signal is to be further processed in order to produce the real video signal.

The CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) sensor consists of a rectangular array of photodiodes. The junction of each photodiode is precharged and it is discharged when hit by photons. The difference from CCD is that
