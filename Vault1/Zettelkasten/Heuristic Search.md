# Heuristic Search

Definition of **Heuristic Function**:
Let $\prod$ be a planning task with state space $\prod' = (S, L, c, T, I, S^G)$. A heuristic function, short heuristic, for $\prod$ is a function $h : S \rightarrow R^+_0 \cup \{\infty\}$. Its value $h(s)$ for a state $s$ is referred to as the state’s heuristic value, or $h$ value.

Definition of **Remaining Cost, h**. Let Π be a planning task with state space ΘΠ = (S, L, c, T, I, SG). For a state s ∈ S, the state’s remaining cost is the cost of an optimal plan for s, or ∞ if there exists no plan for s. The perfect heuristic for Π, written h ∗ , assigns every s ∈ S its remaining cost as the heuristic value.
