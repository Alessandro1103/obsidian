# Image Processing

For each coloured image we use a matrix for each color, what we obtain at the end is a tensor.

## Point Processing

Each pixel is a version of the previous one

**Gamma Correction**: is a technique used to adjust the luminance of an image. It's based on the principle that out eyes perceive light non-linearly, we are more sensitive to dark then light tones. $V_{out} = AV_{in}^{\gamma}$


### Histogram Equalization 

It is a type of graph that represents the frequency distribution of a dataset. Equalization change the intensity so the contrast is improved. We can understand how well the colors are distributed looking at the "cumulative intensity" (the black line). If linear the image is well contrasted.

**Intensity Histogram**: $p(r)=\frac{\text{Number of pixels with intensity r}}{\text{Total number of pixels}}$ it is a graph representing the distribution of pixel intensities in an image.

**Formula**: 
$$
\begin{align*}
& T(r) = \text{round}\bigg(255 \sum_{i=0}^r p(i)\bigg) & 0\leq r \leq 255
\end{align*}
$$
