# Features

We can have:
- **Global Features**: are attributes that generalize the entire object within an image
- **Local Features**: are descriptors of image patches or key points in the image of an object

## Why detect features

1. **Object Recognition**: Identifying and labelling objects within an image. Feature detection helps in distinguishing objects based on their distinct characteristics such as shape, texture, and color.

2. **Localization and Mapping**: Essential in robotics and autonomous vehicle navigation, this process involves determining the position of the device relative to its environment and constructing a map of the surrounding area using detected features.

3. **3D Reconstruction**: Creating three-dimensional models from two-dimensional images. Features detected across multiple images are used to infer the depth and structure of the scene, building a spatial representation.

4. **Augmented Reality**: Enhancing the real world with digital overlays. Feature detection allows the AR system to understand the environment and accurately place digital objects in real-world contexts.

5. **Image Matching (hard situation, SIFT features matching)**: Comparing and aligning different images based on detected features, even under challenging conditions such as changes in scale, orientation, and lighting. SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) is a robust method for matching features across varied scenarios.
