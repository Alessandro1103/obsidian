# Machine Learning & Shakespeare

William Shakespeare was the house playwright for an acting company called **King's Men**. Once he died, the company needed a replacement and took one of the most important playwrights of the time, **John Fletcher**. 
During years, in particular, has been noticed, by **James Spedding**, a literary analyst, a similarity between Fletchers's play and passages in Shakespeare's **Henry VIII**. Spedding concluded that Fletcher and Shakespeare must have collaborated on the play.
Fletcher may not be the only one who collaborated with Shakespeare, there are some ideas about other writers, like Massinger. From all research made by artificial intelligence only a few are relatable to Massinger style and those were voted by a minority. 
The evidence comes from studies of each author's linguistic idiosyncrasies, writing styles. For example, Fletcher used to write _ye_ instead of _you_, and _'em_ instead of _them_. He also tended to add _sir_ or _still_ or _next_ to a standard pentameter line to create a extra sixth syllable.
The text is extremely difficult to divide by humans.
A scientist resolved the problem using machine learning to identify the authorship of more or less every line of the play.
The technique used, is called, **Rolling Stylometry**, designed for cases involving mixed authorship. In this context, we are no longer interested in the whole play, just a number of phrases/words. The algorithm chops the text into phrases and analyses them one at the time. Overlapping the text multiple times.
The results explain that the opera was a mixed authorship, where in some paragraph Shakespeare had the whole control, and left some spaces to Fletcher. There are scenes with both participations.
This algorithm has been used for some years to identify distinctive patterns in the way authors write. In the painting area, machine learning improved so much that it became able to extract a painter style and reuse it on other images.
