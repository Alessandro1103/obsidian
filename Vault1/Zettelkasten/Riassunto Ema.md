## Consumer Brand
The document titled "Consumer Brand Engagement, Satisfaction and Brand Loyalty: A Comparative Study Between Functional and Emotional Brand Relationships" by Teresa Fernandes and Mariana Moreira is a comprehensive research paper focusing on consumer brand engagement (CBE) and its impact on brand loyalty (BL), particularly examining the differences in CBE in functional versus emotional consumer–brand relationships. Here are the key points summarized from the entire document:

1. **Study Objective**: The purpose of the study is to understand differences in CBE according to the functional or emotional nature of consumer–brand relationships and its direct and/or indirect impact on BL. It also aims to compare CBE and Satisfaction as predictors of BL, considering the two types of consumer–brand relationships.

2. **Key Findings**: The study validates CBE as a three-dimensional construct, stronger for emotional than functional brand relationships, and shows its significant direct and indirect impact on BL. It proves that the effects of CBE on BL, directly or indirectly through Satisfaction, are stronger for emotional relationships, while Satisfaction is a stronger direct predictor of BL for functional brand relationships.

3. **Methodology**: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on two independent samples, focusing on brands with which respondents had functional and emotional relationships, respectively. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used for data analysis.

4. **Consumer Brand Engagement**: CBE is defined as a consumer’s cognitive, emotional, and behavioral brand-related activities related to specific interactions. The study underscores the importance of CBE in fostering deeper, relationship-based consumer engagement.

5. **Functional vs. Emotional Brand Relationships**: The research distinguishes between functional brand relationships (focused on utilitarian aspects) and emotional brand relationships (centered on symbolic benefits and self-expressive value).

6. **Results on Brand Loyalty**: CBE has a positive direct impact on BL. Satisfaction mediates the CBE to BL path. The study found that CBE is a stronger direct predictor of BL for emotional than for functional consumer–brand relationships.

7. **Managerial Implications**: The findings suggest that brand managers should engage consumers beyond transactional satisfaction, especially for brands aiming to establish an emotional connection. The role of CBE in influencing consumer satisfaction and loyalty offers crucial insights for brand management strategies.

8. **Conclusions**: The study concludes that CBE is crucial for both functional and emotional brands in enhancing brand loyalty. It adds to the existing knowledge by establishing the mediating role of satisfaction and comparing the contribution of CBE and satisfaction to BL according to the nature of consumer–brand relationships.

## Consumer Identity

The document titled "Imaginary Futures: Liminoid Advertising and Consumer Identity" by Chris Hackley, Rungpaka Amy Hackley, and Dina H. Bassiouni, published in the Journal of Marketing Communications, explores the concept of liminoid advertising and its impact on consumer identity. This comprehensive research paper delves into how advertising often implies that brands can act as doorways to new identities and lifestyles. Here's a detailed summary of the document:

1. **Concept of Liminoid Advertising**: The paper introduces the concept of liminoid advertising, drawing on anthropological theory. Liminoid experiences allow for the temporary suspension of personal and social identity, opening up transformational possibilities. Unlike liminal experiences, which are often tied to ritual processes, liminoid experiences are voluntary, repeatable, and engaged in for enjoyment.

2. **Advertising Appeals**: The study discusses various advertising appeals, distinguishing them as either emotional or rational. It notes how liminoid advertising suggests that consuming a promoted product or brand can act as a gateway to a world of flux and experimentation, where consumer identities are fluid and impermanent.

3. **Consumer Identity and Liminality**: The paper reviews literature on liminality in consumer identity, showing how consumption plays a symbolic role in identity exploration and change. It discusses how Turner’s theories of liminality and liminoid experiences are adapted to understand consumer behavior, specifically in the context of marketing and advertising.

4. **Case Examples**: The authors provide examples of advertising campaigns that exemplify liminoid appeals, demonstrating the novelty and salience of this concept in marketing. These examples illustrate how brands use liminoid advertising to suggest the potential for personal transformation through consumption.

5. **Socio-Cultural Implications**: The paper cautions that while liminoid appeals resonate with consumers for their ostensibly liberatory and self-actualizing potential, they could contribute to rising social disharmony and psychological distress. It highlights the need for understanding the broader social impact of such advertising strategies.

6. **Practical Implications for Marketers**: For brand managers, the study underscores the importance of understanding the role of liminoid advertising in engaging consumers. It suggests that liminoid advertising can be a powerful tool for motivating consumers by tapping into their desire for identity experimentation and transformation.

7. **Conclusions and Future Research**: The paper concludes by emphasizing the significance of liminoid advertising in contemporary consumer culture. It calls for further research to categorize liminoid advertising appeals and investigate their impact on different consumer demographics and sectors.

This comprehensive analysis of the document covers the entire content, providing insights into how the concept of liminoid advertising is relevant in understanding consumer behaviour and the role of advertising in shaping consumer identity.
