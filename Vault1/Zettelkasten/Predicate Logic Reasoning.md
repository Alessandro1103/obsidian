# Predicate Logic Reasoning

## Reduction to Propositional Logic

To move from FOL to Propositional Logic:
1. Bring into Skolem normal form (SNF).
2. Generate (the finite subsets of) the Herbrand expansion.
3. Use the propositional reasoning.

This first two instruction are needed to remove all the variables, eliminate all the things that belongs in FOL and don't in Propositional Logic. 

We assume: Skolem normal form:

...


**Herbrand Expansion**:
	Let $\theta^*$ be a set of FOL formulas in SNF. THe
