# ML ExamQuestion

- The optimal bias classifier is returning a weighted average of all prediction of all the hypothesis. This is impractical because we can not iterate over all the possible hypothesis
- Is the $h_{MAP}$ the best we can do? No: 
  ![[Pasted image 20231217181737.png|300]] we have 0.6 of minus, better than 0.4 of plus
- What happens when we have noise data in KNN and K=1? With �=1k=1, the model is extremely sensitive to outliers and noise. If a data point has a noisy label, the model will strongly rely on that single point, leading to overfitting
- Draw the solution of a particular ML method (check the assumption)
- What is the difference between Supervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning? The actions to be executed are different, in the SL the action is the best because someone said it, in RL the action tries to be the best but at the start could be even the worst. 
- What is the difference between tree and optimal policy? That a tree explore all the graph starting from a root, an optimal policy consider for each state an action, so we reach the goal, but there are some states that do not comes from the "root"
