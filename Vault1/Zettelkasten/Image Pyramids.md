# Image Pyramids

## Gaussian Pyramid

It's a series of lower resolution version of the original image.

Reducing an image by $\frac{1}{4}$, the sum of this infinite geometric series lead to: $S=\frac{a}{1-r}$, where $a$ is the first element, $r$ is the common ratio: $S = \frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{4}{3}$. This value represents the possible space occupied by the image if we tend to infinite, $\frac{4}{3}$ of the original size.

## Laplacian Pyramid

The residual highlights the details that have been "lost" due to the blurring process.
If we store the *residuals* we can reconstruct the original image after its blurriness.

>[!Algorithm] Reconstruct Laplacian pyramid
>1. Start from the smallest and highest image in the Gaussian pyramid
>2. Up-sample (e.g. bilinear, bicubic...) and add the residual
>3. Repeat for all levels

The space calculation made before can be done for this as well. In particular instead of levels we store residuals, so the result is the same.

Image pyramids are used in: 
- Image compression
- Image blending
- Denoising
- Multi-scale detection/registration

## Steerable pyramid

The Steerable Pyramid is a multi-scale, multi-orientation image decomposition method. Used in texture analysis, compression, denoising, edge detention.

## Wavelets pyramids

Wavelet analysis is a method used to separate the information in an image into high-frequency details and low-frequency approximations using high-pass and low-pass filters.
