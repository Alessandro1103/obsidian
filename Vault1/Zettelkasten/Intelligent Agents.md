# Intelligent Agents

An **Agent** is something that perceive the environment through sensor and act through actuators (humans, animals...). The agent does what it does trying to maximize a performance measure. This is not always possible, due to mechanism or algorithm loss. 
There are 2 kind of agents:
- Omniscient agent: knows everything about the environment and the actual effects of its action.
- Rational agent: always makes the best of what he has at its disposal.

An agent has a performance measure M and a set A of actions. Given a perception sequence P, as well as knowledge K about the world, it selects an action a∈A. This action "a" is *optimal* if it maximizes the expected value of M, given the evidence provided by P and K. The agent is rational if it always chooses an optimal a.
