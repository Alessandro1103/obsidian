## Introduction

## First Test
The first step taken to work on this homework works on finding a solution. To see if everything was well managed I try to train and test the dataset over a random method. The test is made over the dataset1 dataset, tested over the blindTest1.csv. I didn't think about a pre-processing method, I could use a dataset standardization, or check the outliners to see if I could improve the distribution to get a better solution. Avoiding every kind of semplification, or improvements, I just run the code over the DecisionalTree() method, obtaining a proper solution, with sufficient evaluation. Just to verify the correct evaluation over the test, I measured the accuracy: 0.975736. It's quite good considering the condition already explined before. 

Another method to evaluate a classification problem is using a confusion matrix, to und
