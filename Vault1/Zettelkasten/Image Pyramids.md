# Image Pyramids

## Gaussian Pyramid

It's a series of lower resolution version of the original image. 

**Algorithm**: 
1. Take the origina image
2. Apply Gaussian Blurring
3. Sub-sample the Blurred image
4. Go to point 2

Reducing an image by $\frac{1}{4}$, the sum of this infinite geometric series lead to: $S=\frac{a}{1-r}$, where $a$ is the first element, $r$ is the common ratio: $S = \frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{4}{3}$.

## Laplacian Pyramid

The residual highlights the details that have been "lost" due to the blurring process.
If we store the *residuals* we can reconstruct the origina image after its blurriness.

**Algorithm**:
1. Start with Gaussian Pyramid
2. Subtract Adjacent Gaussian Levels (for each level in the gaussian pyramid, subtract the next level)
3. Calculate the Residual Images and store them
4. Store the Smallest Gaussian Image

```

**Algorithm** (reconstruct):
1. Start from the smallest and highest image in the Gaussian pyramid
2. Up-sample (e.g. bilinear, bicubic...) and add the residual
3. Repeat for all levels

Image pyramids use: 
- Image compression
- Image blending
- Denoising
- Multi-scale detection/registration
