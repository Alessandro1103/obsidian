# Lezione1

There are 3 types of executed code:
- Interpreter  (Python)
- Emulator program (Java)
- Directly by CPU (kernel)

**CPU**
The CPU executes instructions in a sequential manner.
Each instruction is composed of binary digits, and the CPU retrieves instructions and operands from memory.
The machine instructions have a direct mapping with architecture-specific alphanumeric opcodes (as seen in Assembly language), with a one-to-one correspondence.

**Interpreter**
Interpreters are software applications that carry out the immediate parsing and execution of a source file. The execution process occurs concurrently with the parsing process.
