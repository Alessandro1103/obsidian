# Stereo Matching

## Motivation and history

**Parallax** is a phenomenon where the position or direction of an object appears to differ when viewed from different positions. In simpler terms, it's the apparent shift of an object against a background due to a change in observer position.

Humans perceive depth because of parallax. When you move, objects that are closer to you move faster across your field of view compared to objects that are far away. This is another way we gauge depth and distance while moving, such as when driving or walking.

## Basic two view stereo setup

Stereo matching is the process used to find correspondences between two stereo images. It involves algorithms that identify similar or identical regions in different images to establish how far objects are from the viewer or camera. The depth information, obtained from the disparities in these correspondences, helps in constructing the 3D structure of the scene.

We need to resort on a system like this, where we have the image plane, find the epipolar line that are parallel. We have to calculate the displacement of one image to the other, since if we have a situation like this, there is no rotation of the two camera.

The two coloured images on the left are stereo images. They are two snapshots of the same scene taken from slightly different viewpoints. The differences between these two images are key to deriving depth information.

When you compare two stereo images, objects that are closer to the camera will appear to move more between the two images compared to objects that are farther away. This apparent motion is called disparity.

The difference between the two camera needs to be large enough. And the image needs to be warped.

We need to rectify both images, like warping

THe dimention of the patch is important. The bleck values = is not possible to calcolulate the disparity, meaning that in the other image maybe that pasrt ther isnt.

Left right consistency, apply disparity from a to b, viceversa and then sum up togheter

for each pixel we can say what is the match score? using the similarity matrix we choose.

we have a base scan line, other 2 depending on the camera, since we are measuring the dispariity froma lefto to right, the blue pixel can non be seen from the right and the grey can not be visible from the left. Is it a Minimizazion porblem?

We need to considere the disparity matrix, the ceneter part, and we need to find a path that bring us from start point to the end.

Since we have some missing areas, due to the occlusion

Occlusin costatnt suggest the presence of the occlusion
