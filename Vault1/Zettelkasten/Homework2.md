# Homework2

# Introduction


For this homework, I had to work in Colab and in the Linux space. Colab could not perform the "play" due to an error with the gymnasium. In Linux, or more specifically my PC, I couldn't provide a great GPU to run such a large amount of code.

# Common Elements

## Libraries
Here I present a number of libraries I use in the code, I have selected the most important ones. First, I use TensorFlow, a core library for machine learning. I use it mainly for building and training neural network models. cv2, which is an OpenCV library for Python, which I use for tasks related to seeing and understanding images and videos. To use Colab, I had to use google.colab: It provides functionality to access and manage files in Google Drive from my Colab notebooks. Keras Tuner helps me to tune the hyperparameters of my neural networks. Scikit-Learn helps me to evaluate the performance of my classification models.

## CNN
A CNN, or Convolutional Neural Network, is a type of deep learning algorithm that I can use to analyze visual imagery. It's designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from images. This works really well for image classification problems because a CNN can pick up on patterns like edges, textures, and shapes to determine what's in an image. There are some main components that builds a CNN, different layers that can improve or decrease the performance of the
