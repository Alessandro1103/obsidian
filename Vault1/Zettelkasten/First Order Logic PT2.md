## Propositional

## Substitution & Unification

## FOL Resolution

- A literal $l$ is an atom or the negation thereof; the negation of a literal is denoted $\bar{l}$ (e.g., $\bar{\neg Q}$ = $Q$). 
- A clause $C$ is a set (=disjunction) of literals. 
- Our input is a set $\Delta$ of clauses. 
- The *empty clause* is denoted $\Box$. 
- A *calculus* is a set of inference rules.

Definition of **Derivations**: We say that a clause $C$ can be derived from $\Delta$ using calculus $R$, written $\Delta \vdash_R C$, if (starting from $\Delta$) there is a sequence of applications of rules from R, ending in C.
