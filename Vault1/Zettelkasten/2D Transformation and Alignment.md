# 2D Transformation and Alignment

If we want to create mosaics (take two picture and understand how the should be connected, modifying shape, scale etc) , what we need to do is to understand how an image change. 

We can have general warping:
- filtering, change the range of image: ![[Screenshot from 2024-06-07 16-26-08.png|300]]
- warping, change the domain of image:![[Screenshot from 2024-06-07 16-26-20.png|300]]
In more general way a (global) warping:

![[Screenshot from 2024-06-07 16-28-11.png|300]]

We can define a transformation matrix called $T$:
$$
\begin{align*}
& p'=T(p) & \begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \end{bmatrix} = T \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$
called global because it is the same for any point $p$

## Types of 2D Transformations

### Linear

We have **Rotation** by an angle $\theta$. $R=\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{bmatrix}$ where $R^{-1}=R^T$.

**Scale** around a point: $S = \begin{bmatrix}s_x & 0 \\ 0 & s_y \end{bmatrix}$.

**Shear**: $SH = \begin{bmatrix}1 & sh_x \\ sh_y & 1\end{bmatrix}$

**Mirror**: $M = \begin{bmatrix}-1 & 0 \\0 & -1\end{bmatrix}$

Only linear 2D transformations can be represented with a 2x2 matrix, for example translation is not possible.

### Affine

In order to represent a translation we need to move to 3x3 matrix:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1&0&t_x \\
0&1&t_y \\
0&0&1
\end{bmatrix}
$$
every transformation represented by a 3x3 matrix with last row $\begin{bmatrix}0& 0& 1\end{bmatrix}$, we call an *affine* transformation.

If we have more equations than unknowns we need to find the *least squares solution*:

## Outliers

```slide-note

```

For all possible lines, select the one with the largest number of inliers

```

### RASAC

In order to find a model parameters that maximize the number of inliers, we make the following assumptions:
- All inliers will agree with each other on the model parameters (e.g., translation vector in the context of image alignment)
- Outliers will (hopefully) not agree with each other and with the inliers

The condition to work is that there are less than 50% of outliers

>[!Algorithm General RANSAC]
>1. Randomly choose $s$ samples
>2. Fit a model to those samples
>3. Count the number of inliers that approximately fit the model
>4. Repeat $N$ times
>5. Choose the model that has the largest set of inliers

>[!Algorithm homography RANSAC]
>1. Select four feature pairs
>2. Compute homography H
>3. Compute inliers where dist($p_i'$, $Hp_i$)<$\epsilon$
>4. Keep largest set of inliers
>5. Re-compute least squares H estimate on all of the inliers

To do so, we use the Laplacian Pyramid:

>[!Algorithm Blending]
>1. Build Laplacian Pyramids
>2. Build Gaussian Pyramids
>3. Form a Combined Pyramid: $LS(i,j) = GR(i,j) \cdot LA(i,j) + (1 - GR(i,j)) \cdot LB(i,j)$
>4. Collapse the LS pyramid to get the final blended image
