# MOC

## Emergence Lv1

All MOCs start out as singular notes. And singular notes come from the nothingness of fleeting thoughts.

In this stage, its is just a semblance of a couple of notes that resonated with me from conversation, books, and other information.

## Emergence Lv2

Pretty soon these seemingly unrelated notes started to get linked together. Those three notes from before, all created from information.

## Emergence Lv3

There comes a point in the process where you will want a birds eye view of the relationships between the notes you are connecting together. 
This is when the MOC creation process begins.
There is a gathering, assembling, and incubating of information relevant to the MOC. Usually, this gathering will start out as a list of bu-directionally linked notes. Eventually you might turn this simple list into a paragraph structure.

## Emergence Lv4

At this level MOCs are linked to MOCs! Your in the colliding phase of MOC creation and linking your MOCs to other MOCs. This allows you to fly around your note library rapidly organically getting unforced behaviour based "Spaced repetition".

## Emergence Lv5

The highest level of emergence comes when you create a Home Note with all of your highest order notes. The home note is your beginning and end, your launchpad and homebase.
